/**
 * Event model of the Simple Debugger Plugin.
 * <p>
 * This package contains event classes used for communication between
 * different components of the debugger, including core logic, UI layer,
 * and command handlers.
 * Events represent significant state changes and actions such as debugger
 * lifecycle transitions, execution flow updates, and user-triggered operations.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Events are produced by one part of the system and consumed by others,
 * enabling loose coupling between components and clear separation of concerns
 * across architectural layers.
 * </p>
