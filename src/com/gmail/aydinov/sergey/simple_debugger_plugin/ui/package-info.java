/**
 * User interface layer of the Simple Debugger Plugin.
 * <p>
 * This package contains UI components responsible for presenting
 * debugger state and runtime information to the user.
 * It includes windows, views, and controllers that allow the user
 * to interact with the debugger, control execution flow,
 * and inspect program state.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * UI components in this package communicate with the rest of the system
 * through events and data transfer objects, keeping presentation logic
 * separated from core debugger functionality.
 * </p>
