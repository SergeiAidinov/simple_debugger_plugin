/**
 * Event processing components of the Simple Debugger Plugin.
 * <p>
 * This package contains classes responsible for collecting, queuing,
 * and processing debugger-related events.
 * These components form the processing pipeline that connects
 * event producers (core logic, UI, handlers) with event consumers,
 * ensuring ordered and controlled handling of debugger events.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The processors in this package help to separate event production
 * from event consumption, improving modularity and simplifying
 * coordination between different parts of the debugger.
